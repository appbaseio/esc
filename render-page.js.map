show how to provide an auto-completion of the inputs <strong>as the user types</strong> in a searchbar. We will be using a dataset containing a list of cities and countries and we will be building this feature using Elasticsearch’s <strong>completion</strong> type <code>field</code>.</p>\\n<p><code>Note:</code> Alternate approaches can be implemented using n-grams and prefix suggester algorithms. But speed is the most important aspect for this feature. We’re making suggestions while the user types, so results need to be shown to the user within milliseconds. When using the completion type, Elasticsearch indexes data into a trie like data structure (called FST) which is optimized for fast retrieval and memory usage.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"defining-mappings\\\"><a href=\\\"#defining-mappings\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Defining Mappings</h2>\\n<p>If you have worked with a SQL database system before, you are probably familiar with the idea of a schema.

We will exploit a very cool feature of Elasticsearch called <a href=\\\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html\\\"><strong>multi-fields</strong></a> in doing so. Multi-fields enable indexing the same field in different ways, thus allowing for multiple ways of querying without requiring any additional effort in indexing of the data.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsxon\\\"><code>curl -XPUT $host/normal_searchbar/_mapping/searchbar -d '{\\n  \\\"properties\\\": {\\n    \\\"city\\\": {\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\",\\n      \\\"fields\\\": {\\n        \\\"city_autocomplete\\\": {\\n          \\\"type\\\": \\\"completion\\\",\\n          \\\"analyzer\\\": \\\"simple\\\",\\n          \\\"search_analyzer\\\": \\\"simple\\\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \\\"country\\\": {\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\",\\n      \\\"fields\\\": {\\n        \\\"country_autocomplete\\\": {\\n          \\\"type\\\": \\\"completion\\\",\\n          \\\"analyzer\\\": \\\"simple\\\",\\n          \\\"search_analyzer\\\": \\\"simple\\\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}'</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Here, we have defined a multi-field for both <code>city</code> and <code>country</code> fields.

Elasticsearch’s equivalent of a schema definition is a mapping.</p>\\n<p>By default, Elasticsearch analyzes the data before storing it on disk. It has different tokenizer, analyzer and filters to modify the data. Mappings are useful to attach these analyzers with specific fields. At index time, by default Elasticsearch uses the standard analyzer. Standard analyzer tokenizes the strings and converts it to the lower case tokens.</p>\\n<p>We will use default English analyzer at the index time which can apply stemming, remove stop words, add synonyms to give us better results.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"english-analyzer\\\"><a href=\\\"#english-analyzer\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>English Analyzer</h3>\\n<p>The default analyzer of Elasticsearch contains following components:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Tokenizer</strong>: Splits the text into individual words by space or defined grammar.</li>\\n<li><strong>TokenFilters</strong>: Filters the tokenized words. It lowercases all tokens, removes stop words, removes redundant tokens etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>English analyzer analyzes the text in the following way. Example text - “I’m not happy about the foxes\\n“.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>First it tokenizes the text into words - [I’m, not, happy, about, the, foxes]</li>\\n<li>Lowercases tokens: [i’m, not, happy, about, the, foxes]</li>\\n<li>Removes stopwords: [i’m, happy, about, foxes]</li>\\n<li>Stems tokens to their root form: [i’m, happi, about, fox]</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>By using the english analyzer, we can match text more loosely. By default Elasticsearch uses same analyzer at index time and search time to ensure that the terms in the query are in the same format as the terms in the index.</p>\\n<p>Now, we will specify the mappings for our <code>text</code> field.

fields. Take an e-commerce search experience for instance, here we would want to show our users results that match either the product name or its description.</p>\\n<p>In this post, we will go through the process of building a multi match search experience (i.e. across multiple fields) using Elasticsearch.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"defining-mappings\\\"><a href=\\\"#defining-mappings\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Defining Mappings</h2>\\n<p>If you have worked with a SQL database system before, you are probably familiar with the idea of a schema.

functionalities that we will need for doing this are:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Auto complete</strong> - While user types, we need to provide auto-completion for the input queries. Auto-complete functionality should be as fast as a user types to provide instant feedback relevant to what a user has already typed in.  Elasticsearch provides a convenient way to get autocomplete up and running quickly with its completion suggester feature.</li>\\n<li><strong>Suggestions</strong>(or full text search) - Use quick suggestions to help users save time, iterate on their searches, and get the results they want. It helps to show the relevant data to user inputs.</li>\\n<li><strong>UI</strong> - For building the UI, we will use a React components library that provides us the scaffolding for the UI where we can inject the Elasticsearch query.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><code>Note:</code> You can deep dive into the implementation details of the above two functionalities through these chapters - <a href=\\\"https://github.com/appbaseio/esc/blob/master/searchbar/auto-complete.md\\\">Auto Completion</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/appbaseio/esc/blob/master/searchbar/suggestions.md\\\">Suggestions</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"defining-mappings\\\"><a href=\\\"#defining-mappings\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Defining Mappings</h2>\\n<p>If you have worked with a SQL database system before, you are probably familiar with the idea of a schema. Elasticsearch’s equivalent of a schema definition is a mapping.</p>\\n<p>In this section, we will specify the mappings for our two fields: city and country, with the necessary settings to enable auto-complete and suggestion functionalities.</p>\\n<p><code>auto-suggest</code> analyzer will be useful to get the suggestions. For the auto completion we will use the <code>simple</code> analyzer that tokenizes the text as is (i.e. no white space splitting) and applies a lowercase filter.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsxon\\\"><code>curl -XPUT $host/normal_searchbar/_settings?pretty -d '{\\n  \\\"analysis\\\": {\\n    \\\"tokenizer\\\": {\\n      \\\"ngramizer\\\": {\\n        \\\"type\\\": \\\"ngram\\\",\\n        \\\"min_gram\\\": 1,\\n        \\\"max_gram\\\": 10,\\n        \\\"token_chars\\\": [\\n          \\\"letter\\\",\\n          \\\"digit\\\",\\n          \\\"punctuation\\\",\\n          \\\"symbol\\\"\\n        ]\\n      }\\n  },\\n    \\\"analyzer\\\": {\\n      \\\"auto-suggest\\\": {\\n        \\\"type\\\": \\\"custom\\\",\\n        \\\"tokenizer\\\": \\\"ngramizer\\\",\\n        \\\"filter\\\": [\\n          \\\"lowercase\\\",\\n          \\\"asciifolding\\\"\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}'</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We just added a custom analyzers.

A tag wise search is also fundamentally different from a full-text search as here, we are finding an exact match of a tag with a content item.</p>\\n<p>In this post, we will be using an Array datastructure to store labels with a content document. For making the exact lookups, we will be applying  a term query on the dataset.</p>\\n<p>In Elasticsearch, there is no dedicated array type. Any field can contain zero or more values by default, however, all values in the array must be of the same datatype. If you create a new field by indexing an array, Elasticsearch will use the datatype of the first value in the array to determine the type of the new field. We can create array of strings, integers, objects or array of arrays to store the data.</p>\\n<p>Elasticsearch can also supports empty array or null array values.</p>\\n<p>Default array does not support quering each object independently of the other objects in the array.

It can also help with showing the relevant data to user’s inputs. We will be using a dataset containing a list of cities and countries and we will be building this feature using a custom n-gram analyzer.</p>\\n<p>To implement this functionality, we will use a n-gram tokenizer with a custom type analyzer. A custom analyzer allows to combine character filters, tokenizer, and token filters all at once. In this case we have used a self defined <code>tokenizer</code> called <code>ngramizer</code> which will split on characters that don’t belong to the classes specified in <code>token_chars</code> field.</p>\\n<p><code>Note:</code> An alternate approach can be implemented using Elasticsearch’s <strong>completion</strong> type and queried using a  <strong>suggester</strong> type query.

However, all values in the array must be of the same datatype. If you create a new field by indexing an array, Elasticsearch will use the datatype of the first value in the array to determine the type of the new field. We can create array of strings, integers, objects or array of arrays to store the data.</p>\\n<p>Default array does not support querying each object independently of the other objects in the array. To distinguish objects stored in array from each other we need to use <strong>Nested datatype</strong>.</p>\\n<p><code>Note:</code> You can read more about nested datatype over <a href=\\\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"defining-mappings\\\"><a href=\\\"#defining-mappings\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Defining Mappings</h2>\\n<p>If you have worked with a SQL database system before, you are probably familiar with the idea of a schema. Elasticsearch’s equivalent of a schema definition is a mapping.</p>\\n<p>By default Elasticsearch analyzes the data before storing it on disk. However, since we require an exact match of the data for repository tags, we will apply a <code>index: not_analyzed</code> setting to prevent the tag field from being analyzed.</p>\\n<p>We will only specify the mapping for the tags field.
