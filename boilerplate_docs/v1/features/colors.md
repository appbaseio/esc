# Colors

Your docs are where your users spend a significant time, they should look beautiful. Colors are baked right in docbase's design.

## Theme Color

Docbase lets you pick color for the primary theme and automatically builds colorful docs from there.

Let's see how docbase would look for the color **#dd6a58**.

A valid color can be a rgb value, hex code or even names like green, oceanblue, orangered.

## Extending

While docbase comes with sensible defaults, it is also easy to extend. Beyond colors, you can create custom backgrounds, provide your own navigation or even create a custom documentation home page.
